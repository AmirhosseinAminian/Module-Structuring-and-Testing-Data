Open a new window in Chrome,

then locate the **Console** tab.

Voila! You now have access to the [Chrome V8 Engine](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/serverless/glossary/what-is-chrome-v8/).
Just like the Node REPL, you can input JavaScript code into the Console tab and the V8 engine will execute it.

Let's try an example.

In the Chrome console,
invoke the function `alert` with an input string of `"Hello world!"`;

What effect does calling the `alert` function have?
Displays a popup alert with the message 

Now try invoking the function `prompt` with a string input of `"What is your name?"` - store the return value of your call to `prompt` in an variable called `myName`.

What effect does calling the `prompt` function have?
Displays a dialog box with a text input field and two buttons: "OK" and "Cancel.
What is the return value of `prompt`?
If the user enters text and clicks "OK," the return value is the entered text and will store it.
If the user clicks "Cancel" or closes the prompt, the return value is null.
